# Auto-Differentiable Discrete Integral Transform

JAX-implementation of [DIT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022407320310049) for rapid spectral synthesis, originally proposed by D.van den Bekerom and E.Pannier.

This code is developed mainly for [exojax](https://github.com/HajimeKawahara/exojax), but also includes some snipets, test, and codes under development. So, it might not be well structured.
